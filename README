Evolution is a simple "evolution" simulator. As of now (June 2014) I intend it to be relatively small and incorporate only a few basic traits (height or speed) that can change according to different stimuli (such as food shortage and over population). 
It currently only spawns two "animals" which then attempt to mate and produce new offspring each "year".
